title: 'Relayer Service'
description: 'Optional service for gasless transactions and enhanced privacy'

> The relayer is **not part of the core Yona protocol**. It is an _optional external service_ designed to boost privacy.

The relayer network is fully permissionless - anyone can run a relayer to process transactions and earn fees. The protocol facilitates matching between users and competing independent relayers, remaining neutral and non-custodial.

## Overview

A relayer is an intermediary service that:

- Submits transactions on behalf of users
- Pays transaction fees and nullifier costs in SOL
- Collects a service fee (see [Fees](./fees.mdx))
- Enhances privacy by decoupling submission from wallet address

This is particularly useful for users who want to withdraw or swap funds without first acquiring SOL or revealing their withdrawal address.

## How It Works

### Transaction Flow

```
User generates ZK proof using frontend and secret message(can do it locally)
   ↓
User sends proof + withdrawal details to relayer
   ↓
Relayer validates proof structure
   ↓
Relayer submits transaction to blockchain
   ↓
Relayer pays gas fees in SOL for the transaction and nullifier costs
   ↓
User receives funds minus relayer fee 
```

### Privacy Benefits

- **No SOL Required:** Withdraw without pre-funding an address
- **Address Unlinking:** Relayer's address submits the transaction, not yours

---


## Relayer Limitations

The relayer **cannot**:
- Steal your funds (proof is cryptographically bound to the transaction data)
- Modify transaction data (proof validates exact data)
- Link deposits to withdrawals (zero-knowledge property)
- Access your private keys or UTXOs

He only can **reject** the transaction if its economically unfeasible to process it.
