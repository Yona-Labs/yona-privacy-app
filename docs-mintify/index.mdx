description: "We enable private trustless DeFi on Solana."

Yona is a privacy protocol on Solana that lets you shield SOL and any SPL token into our privacy pool and trade any pair privately on Jupiter. 
Any action done through our protocol is fully untraceable by any external observer. 
They will see that the Jupiter swap happened, but they will not know who executed the trade.

 
Using zero-knowledge proofs, you can prove a transaction is valid without exposing amounts or participants.
It only relies on ZK cryptography, no trusted parties, no questionable TEEs.



## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Deposit Tokens">
    Send tokens to the protocol and receive a private note. This note represents your balance but doesn't reveal any information on-chain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Private Transactions">
    Use your notes to transact privately. The protocol verifies you have the funds without revealing which deposit you're spending from.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Withdraw or Swap">
    Withdraw to any address or swap to different tokens. The recipient can't trace back to your original deposit.
  </Step>
</Steps>
